# linear_regression_demo
The dataset we're using to train our model is a list of brain weight and body weight measurements from a bunch of animals. We'll fit our line to the data using the scikit learn machine learning library, then plot our graph using matplotlib.

##Dependencies

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib

You can just run
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 
in terminal to install the necessary dependencies. Here is a link to [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) if you don't already have it.

##Usage

Type `python demo.py` into terminal and you'll see the scatter plot and line of best fit appear.
